# Weekly-Project-UNIT-1

This is the first weekly project of the Epicode's Full-Stack course.

In this exercise, we were asked to design and develop a Mobile website starting from a Mockup.jpg . (This Mockup was provided from the Epicode's staff.)
Finished this task, we were also asked to build a second version of the website, for a display width of 1920px.

The exercise was finished and delivered in time as requested by the Epicode's staff, anyway in the last two days i revisited some minor changes to both of the website versions (to maintain myself in exercise).

The repository it's composed by:

- The Desktop folder = for the desktop version of the project;

- The Mobile folder = for the mobile version of the project;

- The Mockup folder = with the starting mockup of the project;

- This readme file.
